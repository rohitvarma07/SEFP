+4 Deliverables
+
+Milestones Due Date Release Deliverable?
+Prototype of app 25/10/2015 Pre-
+Beta Yes
+Final Version of game web based app 31/10/2015 Final Yes
+First version of android app 10/11/2015 Pre-
+Beta Yes
+Second version of android app 25/11/2015 Beta Yes
+Final release 10/12/2015 Final Yes
+
+5 Risk Management
+
+5.1 Risk Identification
+
+Main risk is to use google distance matrix api as api cost nothing for 2500
+use per day after that we need to pay.We need to use the api judiciously so
+that we can't ask api distance between two place which we have already
+asked.
+
+5.2 Risk Mitigation
+
+We need to store distance between two place in a database after it is asked
+for the first
+time and we need to look into database for the distance once it is asked
+again.
+
