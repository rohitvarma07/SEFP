General Usage Notes:

This is a game where you need to shift the alphabets in such a way that all the alpphabets are arranged in an order. 

Try to put all the pieces in alphabetical order, 'అ' through 'ఔ'.
The number of moves done by a player to complete the game will be mentioned below.

There is no undo option.

Time taken by the player will not be counted,so you can take your own time in solving the matrix.

Alphabets are generated randomly whenever the page is refreshed,so you cannot expect the same set of alphabets every time.
